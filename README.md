Machine Learning Project: Personalized Interest-Based Feed Generator
Overview
This machine learning project aims to create a personalized feed for users based on their areas of interest. The recommendation system utilizes collaborative filtering and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms to generate a custom feed for each user. The web interface is implemented using the Streamlit Python library.


Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/1shweta3/Feed-Generation-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd interest-based-feed-generator
Prepare your dataset:

Ensure that your dataset is formatted correctly with the required features. Place the dataset file in the data/ directory.

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Explore the Interest_Based_Feed_Generator.ipynb notebook to understand the data preprocessing, model training (collaborative filtering, KNN), and feed generation steps.

Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This command will launch a local web server, and you can access the app in your web browser at http://localhost:8501. Use the app to input your areas of interest and receive a personalized feed based on collaborative filtering and KNN recommendations.

Model Details
The recommendation algorithm includes collaborative filtering and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to analyze user behavior and generate personalized recommendations. Collaborative filtering identifies similar users and recommends items based on their preferences, while KNN identifies similar items based on user preferences.

Web Interface Features
User-friendly form for inputting areas of interest.
Real-time personalized feed displayed on the web interface.
Clear and intuitive design for ease of use.
Future Improvements
Explore options for deploying the Streamlit app on cloud platforms.
Enhance the model with additional features for more accurate recommendations.
Incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement.
Feel free to contribute to the project, open issues, or suggest improvements. Happy exploring! üåê‚ú®
